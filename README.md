Introduction
The Family Tree Application is a console-based Java program designed to create and display family tree. It enables users to record and visualize relationships within a family by adding members under specific parents and viewing the hierarchical structure in a user-friendly format.
-What It Can Do
Add Family Members : Users can expand the family tree by adding children under specific parent nodes.
Display the Family Tree : Prints the entire family tree with hierarchical formatting, showing relationships clearly.
Interactive Menu : A simple menu-driven interface makes it easy to navigate and perform tasks.
Exit the Application: Allows users to exit gracefully after completing their tasks.
Why This Application Was Created
I created the Family Tree Application to explore the use of tree data structures in a practical and meaningful context. The concept of a family tree is widely understood, making it an accessible way to learn and demonstrate skills in programming, recursion, and object-oriented design. Additionally, it serves as a stepping stone for developing more complex applications, such as genealogy tools or organizational charts.
